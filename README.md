# Fortress Builder

This is a fortress building web app game. It is mainly serving as a **showcase project** for a bunch of technologies and patterns used together instead of being an actual product / game that's meant to be played.

## Used Technologies

### Next.js

This project is based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) since it is a well maintened, modern framework that delivers lots of useful features like file-based routing, middleware and much more.
